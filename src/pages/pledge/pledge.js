						<strong>TEGA</strong> Members are primarily focused on helping the

						management skills in a low risk, real-time simulated environment.
						<strong>TEGA</strong> Members strongly believe that the experience
						of simulated trading, as experiential learning, is a valuable
						educational piece that will help increase the likelihood of trader
						success. Members provide a real-time simulated trading environment
						to help aspiring futures traders safely learn how to trade and to
						develop the skills and the discipline necessary to be more prepared
						for live trading, whether it be their personal or proprietary
						capital. <strong>TEGA</strong> Members believe the service provided
						is good for the trading community and the financial industry as a
